in this paper, a novel decorrelation-based concurrent digital predistortion (dpd) solution is proposed for dual-band transmitters (tx) employing a single wideband power amplifier (pa), and utilizing just a single feedback receiver path. the proposed decorrelation-based parameter learning solution is both flexible and simple, and operates in a closed-loop manner, opposed to the widely applied indirect learning architecture. the proposed decorrelation-based learning and dpd processing can also be effectively applied to more ordinary single-band transmissions, as well as generalized to more than two transmit bands. through a comprehensive analysis covering both the dpd parameter learning and the main path processing, it is shown that the complexity of the proposed concurrent dpd is substantially lower compared with the other state-of-the-art concurrent dpd methods. extensive set of quantitative simulation and rf measurement results are also presented, using a base-station pa as well as a commercial lte-advanced mobile pa, to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed dpd solution in various real world scenarios, incorporating single-band/dual-band tx cases. the simulation and rf measurement results demonstrate excellent linearization performance of the proposed concurrent dpd, even outperforming current state-of-the-art methods, despite the significantly lower complexity.
