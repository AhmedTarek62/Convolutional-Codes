# Convolutional-Codes
Implementation of the encoder for Convolutional Codes and the Viterbi Decoder
The project consists of two main modules:
The convolutional encoder function with encodes a binary stream using user defined generator polynomials.
Constraint length = 3, Code Rate = 1/3
Viterbi Decoder which uses the Viterbi algorithm to decode a binary stream that is encoded using a convolutional code
Note: The project features previously implemented Huffman code Modules that are used to simulate an end-to-end baseband communication system featuring Source Coding and Channel Coding
